Unleash the power of the **Pythonic way**; strive for readability and conciseness, weaving your code like a fine tapestry—think of it as your cheeseboard, where each piece complements the other.\\n\\n2. **Aged to Perfection**: Like a fine Gouda, time and experience enhance your skills. Practice daily, for in the realm of coding, much like in the art of cheese, neglect renders you stale. With each line you scribe, you steer your craft towards a sharper edge!\\n\\n3. **Feta the Challenge**: Embrace difficulties, for they are crumbles on the platter of learning. Seek out **exercises** and **projects**, from the mild to the pungent. The more you confront conundrums, the more your abilities will mature, just as a cheese ferments in the cave!\\n\\n4. **Mold Your Realm**: Enlist in the grand guild of fellow coders. Communities are like the rinds that protect the cheese from decay. Engage in forums, code reviews, and peer groups. Share your wisdom and absorb ideas—this symbiosis is the very blue vein of development!\\n\\n5. **Savor the Libraries**: Venture deep into the pantry of Python’s **libraries and frameworks**. Each one a distinct flavor, they can transform your programming from mild to extraordinary. Like pairing cheddar with apple, find harmony in the modules that suit your needs!\\n\\n6. **Documentation à la Camembert**: Keep notes and write your own documentation—therein lies clarity! A well-documented code is like a well-aged cheese, delightful and digestible to others (and your future self).\\n\\n7. **Assemble the Paired Platter**: In your quest to learn, don’t neglect the companions of Python: understanding algorithms, data structures, and even a sprinkle of algorithms like a dash of Cayenne on a creamy cheese dip can elevate your coding dish to greatness!\\n\\nNow, go forth, intrepid soul, and let your Pythonic journey be as versatile as a cheese board at a grand feast!

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",

        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",

        "   }\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",

              "'LCEL, or LangChain Expression Language, is a declarative framework for composing chains together. It offers several benefits over traditional coding for constructing chains:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains created using LCEL automatically support synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations, making it convenient to prototype in environments like Jupyter notebooks and scale to asynchronous streaming interfaces.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: LCEL allows for easy attachment of fallbacks to chains, which is crucial given the non-deterministic nature of Language Models (LLMs). This means that errors can be handled gracefully.\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: Since LLM applications often involve potentially long API calls, LCEL allows components that can run in parallel to do so automatically, enhancing efficiency.\\n\\nIn summary, LCEL enables developers to build flexible, efficient, and robust chains with built-in support for various operational modes and error handling.'"
