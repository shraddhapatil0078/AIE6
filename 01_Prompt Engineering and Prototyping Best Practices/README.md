### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
  ![Q1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abc6a1e1-9d74-47d7-84d4-3189ccd1a5e7)

    - Aspect Tested:
     **Clarity and Simplicity** - The chatbot has generated step by step detail answer with clear points. There is scope to improvement in simple examples.
      
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
     ![Q2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa3e2bca-069d-46a6-8f65-669533210559)
    
    - Aspect Tested:
      **Summarization** - The summary given by chatbot is bit long. It could be little short so here there is scope to improve the promp to give consice summary with specified range.
         
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
   ![Q3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e997e60-f078-4d9d-8c00-4ea378d7f31e)
   
    - Aspect Tested:
    **Creativity & Coherence** - The chatnot has built nice short story, but it could be more creative and engaging. Let's try adjusting temperature settings
      
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    ![Q4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e860141-5ad4-4d3f-b7c8-82e95ce0fd6a)

    - Aspect Tested: 
     **Logical Reasoning & Math Skills** -  Chatbot has performed correct calculations
      
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
     ![Q5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/970d50f4-512f-4d5d-9b92-e23329e62b1a)

    - Aspect Tested:
     **Language & Formality** - Chatbot has maintain the original meaning while making it more professional. It can be improve to have more humanize respone. 
     
This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool? 

**Subjectivity**: Vibe check reliers mostly on person's opinion which can vary person to person

**Lack of Clear Criteria**: It's difficult to come to a clear criteria or what is good or bad AI output

**Developer Bias:** AI developers' own biases can influence their subjective assessments, leading to skewed evaluations.

**Difficulty in Identifying Root Causes:** - Subjective evaluations may not pinpoint the specific reasons for AI model failures, making it harder to address issues.
